# TO-DO
    # Set objective and functionality
    # User input (case insensitive)
    # Input is read by API and results are returned
    # Store used/liked recipes
    # Storage and manipulation (add and delete) of ingredients or input of all ingredients a user has (?)

## Objective 
    # CookMe_v2 uses the Yummly API to return recipes that could be made with ingredients the user already has.

## Functionality
    # Run the program with python main.py
    # User will have the options to:
        # search recipes based on ingredients
        # search recipes based on inegrients with food restrictions
        # search recipes based on preset ingredients (w/ or w/o food restrictions)

## Security
    # input validation 
    # hidden/hashed API key
    # exception handling
    # raised error (?)

## Further desired development
    # Possible kivy or beeware usage 

## Files
    # auth.py - hashed file with API access
    # main.py - main program
    # Yummly.py - API functionality and classes
